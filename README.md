# WEBEXPO Javascript Prototype

This repository contains the code underlying the WEBEXPO Javascript prototype. It is intended as a demonstration of how to build applications on top of the [WEBEXPO Javascript Library](https://github.com/webexpo/webexpo_js_lib).

The prototype (on-line [here](https://expostats.ca/proto)) works in English or in French.
