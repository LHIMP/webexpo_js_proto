# WEBEXPO JS Prototype

This repository contains the Javascript code of the WEBEXPO prototype. The prototype demonstrates how to build applications on top of the [WEBEXPO JS Library](https://github.com/webexpo/webexpo_js_lib). The code may be downloaded and hosted on your own web server. It is to be run in a web browser.

The scientific report describing the principles and details of the calculations allowed by the WEBEXPO algorithms can be found [here](https://www.irsst.qc.ca/en/publications-tools/publication/i/101066/n/webexpo){target="_blank"}.
